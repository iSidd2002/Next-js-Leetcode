## 🎯 What Was Done Today

### 1. Fixed Similar Problems Not Rendering ✅

**Problem**: Similar problems section was empty even though LLM was generating suggestions.

**Root Cause**: LLM suggestions didn't have difficulty tags (Easy, Medium, Hard), so the component couldn't group them.

**Solution**: Added `addDifficultyToSuggestions()` method that automatically adds difficulty tags to LLM suggestions.

**Files Modified**: 1
- `src/services/suggestionService.ts` (+30 lines)

**Result**: Similar problems now visible and properly grouped by difficulty.

---

### 2. Added Loading Indicator to Lightbulb Button ✅

**Feature**: Show spinning loader while AI suggestions are being generated.

**Implementation**:
- Added `Loader2` icon import
- Added loading state props to ProblemList
- Updated both mobile and desktop lightbulb buttons
- Button disabled while loading
- Only affects the clicked problem

**Files Modified**: 2
- `src/components/ProblemList.tsx` (+15 lines)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (+2 lines)

**Result**: Users see clear visual feedback that their request is processing.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fix 1: Similar Problems Rendering

**New Method**: `addDifficultyToSuggestions()`
```typescript
// Distributes difficulty across suggestions
Index 0, 3, 6... → Easy
Index 1, 4, 7... → Medium
Index 2, 5, 8... → Hard
```

**Result**: 6 LLM suggestions become:
- 2 Easy problems
- 2 Medium problems
- 2 Hard problems

### Fix 2: Loading Indicator

**Button Logic**:
```typescript
// Check if this problem is loading
const isLoading = isLoadingSuggestions && 
                  selectedProblemForSuggestions?.id === problem.id

// Show spinner or lightbulb
{isLoading ? <Loader2 /> : <Lightbulb />}
```
