## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Fix 1: Similar Problems Rendering

**Method**: `addDifficultyToSuggestions()`
- Distributes difficulty across suggestions
- Index 0, 3, 6... → Easy
- Index 1, 4, 7... → Medium
- Index 2, 5, 8... → Hard
- Result: 6 LLM suggestions → 2 Easy + 2 Medium + 2 Hard

### Fix 2: Loading Indicator

**Logic**: Conditional rendering
- Check if this problem is loading
- Show spinner if loading, lightbulb otherwise
- Disable button during loading
- Only affects clicked problem
