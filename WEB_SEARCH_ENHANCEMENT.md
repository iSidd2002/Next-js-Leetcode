# 🌐 Web Search Enhancement - LLM Suggestion Feature

## ✅ Status: WEB SEARCH INTEGRATION COMPLETE

The LLM suggestion feature now searches the internet for real, up-to-date problem recommendations that are platform-specific.

---

## 🎯 What's New

### Before
```
❌ LLM generates suggestions based on training data
❌ Problem recommendations may be generic or outdated
❌ No verification that suggested problems exist
❌ No direct links to problems
```

### After
```
✅ Searches for real problems on each platform
✅ Verifies problems exist and are accessible
✅ Includes direct links to problems
✅ Platform-specific search queries
✅ Up-to-date recommendations
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Web Search Service
```typescript
class WebSearchService {
  // Platform-specific search methods
  async searchCodeForcesProblem(difficulty, topics, missingConcepts)
  async searchLeetCodeProblem(difficulty, topics, missingConcepts)
  async searchAtCoderProblem(difficulty, topics, missingConcepts)

  // Web search via Gemini API
  private async searchViaGemini(query)
  private async performWebSearch(query)

  // Utility methods
  private extractProblemTitle(title)
  async verifyProblemUrl(url)
  getPlatformFromUrl(url)
}
```

### Suggestion Enrichment
```typescript
// In SuggestionService
async generateSuggestions(...) {
  // 1. Generate LLM suggestions
  const result = await this.callGeminiAPI(prompt);

  // 2. Enrich with web search
  result.similarProblems = await this.enrichSimilarProblemsWithWebSearch(
    result.similarProblems,
    difficulty,
    topics,
    missingConcepts,
    platform
  );

  return result;
}
```
