## üéØ Five Selection Strategies

### 1. Difficulty Alignment (25%)
Ensures questions match user's level with optional challenge.

**Three Learning Styles**:
- Progressive: Same or slightly harder
- Challenging: Prefer harder questions
- Mixed: Variety of difficulty levels

---

### 2. Concept Relevance (30%)
Prioritizes questions covering missing concepts.

**Scoring**:
- Missing concepts: 2x weight
- Topic matches: 1x weight
- Combined score normalized to 0-1

---

### 3. User History (20%)
Considers past performance and learning patterns.

**Scoring**:
- New question: 0.8
- Attempted but unsolved: 0.85
- Solved recently: 0.4
- Solved 7+ days ago: 0.9

---

### 4. Spaced Repetition (15%)
Optimal timing for reviewing previously solved problems.

**Scoring**:
- Due today: 1.0
- Due within 3 days: 0.8
- Due within 7 days: 0.6
- Not due soon: 0.2-0.5

---

### 5. Diversity Bonus (10%)
Encourages learning different concepts.

**Scoring**:
- New concepts: +0.33 per concept
- Max bonus: 1.0 (3+ new concepts)

---

## üìä Scoring Formula

```
Total Score = 
  (Difficulty Score √ó 0.25) +
  (Concept Score √ó 0.30) +
  (History Score √ó 0.20) +
  (Spaced Rep Score √ó 0.15) +
  (Diversity Score √ó 0.10)

Final Score: 0-1.0 (normalized)
```

## üöÄ Integration Steps

### Step 1: Import Service
```typescript
import { advancedQuestionSelector } from './advancedQuestionSelector';
```

### Step 2: Add userId Parameter
```typescript
async generateSuggestions(
  ...,
  userId?: string  // NEW
): Promise<SuggestionsResult>
```

### Step 3: Use Advanced Selector
```typescript
const selectedQuestions = await advancedQuestionSelector.selectOptimalQuestions(
  {
    userId,
    currentDifficulty: difficulty,
    topics,
    missingConcepts,
    platform,
    learningStyle: 'progressive',
  },
  availableQuestions
);
```

### Step 4: Update API Route
Pass userId from authenticated request to generateSuggestions()
