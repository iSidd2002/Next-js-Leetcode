## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. User in Review section
   ↓
2. Clicks 💡 on a problem
   ↓
3. SuggestionPanel opens
   ↓
4. Sees 5-6 problems grouped by difficulty
   ├─ Easy Level (2 problems)
   ├─ Medium Level (2 problems)
   └─ Hard Level (2 problems)
   ↓
5. Clicks "Open" on a problem
   ↓
6. Opens in new tab
```

### Technical Flow
```
generateSuggestions()
  ↓
enrichSimilarProblemsWithWebSearch()
  ├─ Try: getVariedDifficultySuggestions()
  │  ├─ searchCodeForcesProblem('800', ...)  → 2 Easy
  │  ├─ searchCodeForcesProblem('1000', ...) → 2 Medium
  │  └─ searchCodeForcesProblem('1600', ...) → 2 Hard
  │
  └─ Fallback: addDifficultyToSuggestions()
     ├─ Add difficulty tags to LLM suggestions
     └─ Distribute across Easy, Medium, Hard
  ↓
rankSuggestionsByTags()
  ↓
Return 6 problems with difficulty labels
  ↓
SuggestionPanel groups by difficulty
  ↓
Render with color-coded badges
```
