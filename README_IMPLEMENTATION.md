## 📋 What Was Done

Two major features were successfully implemented to improve the Review section:

### 1. ✅ Fixed Similar Problems Not Rendering

**Problem**: Similar problems section was empty even though LLM was generating suggestions.

**Solution**: Added `addDifficultyToSuggestions()` method that automatically adds difficulty tags to LLM suggestions.

**Result**: 
- Similar problems now visible (5-6 shown)
- Grouped by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Color-coded badges
- Direct problem links

### 2. ✅ Added Loading Indicator to Lightbulb

**Problem**: No visual feedback while AI suggestions were being generated.

**Solution**: Added spinning loader icon to lightbulb button during suggestion generation.

**Result**:
- Shows spinner while generating
- Button disabled to prevent duplicates
- Only affects clicked problem
- Works on mobile and desktop
