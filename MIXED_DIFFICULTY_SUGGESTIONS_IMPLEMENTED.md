## üéâ Status: FEATURE IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED

Successfully implemented 5-6 problem suggestions with mixed Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties in the Review section.

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Varied Difficulty Suggestion Algorithm
**File**: `src/services/suggestionService.ts`
**Lines**: 229-325

**What it does**:
- Fetches Easy, Medium, and Hard problems simultaneously
- Returns 5-6 problems with balanced difficulty distribution
- Works for all platforms: CodeForces, AtCoder, LeetCode

**Example Output**:
```
Easy Level (2 problems)
  - Problem A (Easy)
  - Problem B (Easy)

Medium Level (2 problems)
  - Problem C (Medium)
  - Problem D (Medium)

Hard Level (2 problems)
  - Problem E (Hard)
  - Problem F (Hard)
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced SuggestionPanel Component
**File**: `src/components/SuggestionPanel.tsx`
**Lines**: 135-216

**What it does**:
- Groups suggestions by difficulty level
- Shows difficulty count: "üîó Similar Problems (6)"
- Color-coded difficulty badges (Green=Easy, Yellow=Medium, Red=Hard)
- Displays concept tags separately from difficulty
- Shows platform badge for each problem

**Visual Layout**:
```
üîó Similar Problems (6)

Easy Level
  ‚îú‚îÄ Problem 1 [Easy] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
  ‚îî‚îÄ Problem 2 [Easy] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]

Medium Level
  ‚îú‚îÄ Problem 3 [Medium] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
  ‚îî‚îÄ Problem 4 [Medium] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]

Hard Level
  ‚îú‚îÄ Problem 5 [Hard] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
  ‚îî‚îÄ Problem 6 [Hard] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Algorithm: getVariedDifficultySuggestions()

```typescript
// For CodeForces
const easyResults = await webSearchService.searchCodeForcesProblem('800', topics, missingConcepts);
const mediumResults = await webSearchService.searchCodeForcesProblem(difficulty, topics, missingConcepts);
const hardResults = await webSearchService.searchCodeForcesProblem('1600', topics, missingConcepts);

// For AtCoder
const easyResults = await webSearchService.searchAtCoderProblem('ABC_A', topics, missingConcepts);
const mediumResults = await webSearchService.searchAtCoderProblem('ABC_C', topics, missingConcepts);
const hardResults = await webSearchService.searchAtCoderProblem('ABC_E', topics, missingConcepts);

// For LeetCode
const easyResults = await webSearchService.searchLeetCodeProblem('Easy', topics, missingConcepts);
const mediumResults = await webSearchService.searchLeetCodeProblem('Medium', topics, missingConcepts);
const hardResults = await webSearchService.searchLeetCodeProblem('Hard', topics, missingConcepts);

// Combine: 2 Easy + 2 Medium + 2 Hard = 6 problems
```

### Component: Grouped Display

```typescript
{['Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard'].map((diffLevel) => {
  const problemsAtLevel = suggestions.similarProblems.filter((p) =>
    p.tags.includes(diffLevel)
  );
  
  return (
    <div key={diffLevel} className="space-y-2">
      <h5 className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase">{diffLevel} Level</h5>
      {problemsAtLevel.map((item, idx) => (
        // Display problem with difficulty badge
      ))}
    </div>
  );
})}
```

## üìä Platform-Specific Difficulty Mapping

Medium: Medium
Hard:   Hard
```

  return (
    <div key={diffLevel} className="space-y-2">
      <h5 className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase">{diffLevel} Level</h5>
      {problemsAtLevel.map((item, idx) => (
        // Display each problem
      ))}
