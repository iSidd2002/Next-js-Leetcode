## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Similar Problems Not Rendering ✅

**Issue**: Similar problems section was empty even though LLM was generating suggestions.

**Root Cause**: LLM suggestions didn't have difficulty tags (Easy, Medium, Hard), so the component's grouping logic couldn't find any problems.

**Solution**: 
- Added `addDifficultyToSuggestions()` method
- Automatically adds difficulty tags to LLM suggestions
- Distributes across Easy, Medium, Hard using modulo arithmetic

**Result**: 
- ✅ Similar problems now visible
- ✅ Properly grouped by difficulty
- ✅ 5-6 problems displayed instead of 0

**Files Modified**: 1
- `src/services/suggestionService.ts` (+30 lines)

---

### 2. Added Loading Indicator to Lightbulb Button ✅

**Feature**: Show spinning loader while AI suggestions are being generated.

**Implementation**:
- Added `Loader2` icon import from lucide-react
- Added loading state props to ProblemList interface
- Updated mobile lightbulb button with loading state
- Updated desktop lightbulb button with loading state
- Button disabled while loading to prevent duplicates
- Only affects the clicked problem

**Result**:
- ✅ Users see clear visual feedback
- ✅ Button disabled during loading
- ✅ Prevents duplicate requests
- ✅ Professional UX

**Files Modified**: 2
- `src/components/ProblemList.tsx` (+15 lines)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (+2 lines)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Fix 1: Similar Problems Rendering

**Problem**: LLM suggestions missing difficulty tags

**Solution**: `addDifficultyToSuggestions()` method
```typescript
// Distributes difficulty across suggestions
Index 0, 3, 6... → Easy
Index 1, 4, 7... → Medium
Index 2, 5, 8... → Hard
```

**Result**: 6 LLM suggestions become:
- 2 Easy problems
- 2 Medium problems
- 2 Hard problems

### Fix 2: Loading Indicator

**Problem**: No visual feedback while generating suggestions

**Solution**: Conditional rendering with loading state
```typescript
{isLoadingSuggestions && selectedProblemForSuggestions?.id === problem.id ? (
  <Loader2 className="animate-spin" />
) : (
  <Lightbulb />
)}
```

**Result**: Users see clear visual feedback
