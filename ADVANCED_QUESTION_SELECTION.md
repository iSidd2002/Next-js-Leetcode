# üéØ Advanced Question Selection System

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Quality**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5)

---

## üìã Overview

A sophisticated algorithm for selecting optimal practice questions based on multiple factors:
- Difficulty progression
- Concept mastery
- Spaced repetition
- User learning history
- Diversity of topics

---

## üéØ Five Selection Strategies

### 1. **Difficulty Alignment (25% weight)**

Ensures questions match user's current level with optional challenge.

**Three Learning Styles**:
- **Progressive**: Same or slightly harder questions
- **Challenging**: Prefer harder questions for growth
- **Mixed**: Variety of difficulty levels

**Score Calculation**:
```
Progressive: Same difficulty = 1.0, +1 level = 0.8, -1 level = 0.6
Challenging: Harder = 0.9+, Same = 0.7, Easier = 0.5
Mixed: Same = 0.8, ¬±1 level = 0.9, Other = 0.5
```

---

### 2. **Concept Relevance (30% weight)**

Prioritizes questions covering missing concepts.

**Scoring**:
- Missing concepts: 2x weight
- Topic matches: 1x weight
- Combined score normalized to 0-1

**Example**:
```
User missing: [Dynamic Programming, Greedy]
Question tags: [DP, Arrays, Greedy]
Score: (2 matches √ó 2 + 0 matches √ó 1) / (2 √ó 2 + 0 √ó 1) = 1.0
```

---

### 3. **User History (20% weight)**

Considers past performance and learning patterns.

**Scoring**:
- New question: 0.8 (good for learning)
- Attempted but unsolved: 0.85 (good for retry)
- Solved recently (< 3 days): 0.4 (lower priority)
- Solved 3-7 days ago: 0.7 (moderate priority)
- Solved > 7 days ago: 0.9 (good for review)

---

### 4. **Spaced Repetition (15% weight)**

Optimal timing for reviewing previously solved problems.

**Scoring**:
- Due today: 1.0 (perfect)
- Due within 3 days: 0.8 (good)
- Due within 7 days: 0.6 (moderate)
- Not due soon: 0.2-0.5 (lower priority)

---

### 5. **Diversity Bonus (10% weight)**

Encourages learning different concepts.

**Scoring**:
- New concepts in question: +0.33 per concept
- Max score: 1.0 (3+ new concepts)

---

## üìä Scoring Formula

```
Total Score = 
  (Difficulty Score √ó 0.25) +
  (Concept Score √ó 0.30) +
  (History Score √ó 0.20) +
  (Spaced Rep Score √ó 0.15) +
  (Diversity Score √ó 0.10)

Final Score: 0-1.0 (normalized)
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { advancedQuestionSelector } from '@/services/advancedQuestionSelector';

const selectedQuestions = await advancedQuestionSelector.selectOptimalQuestions(
  {
    userId: 'user123',
    currentDifficulty: 'Medium',
    topics: ['Arrays', 'Sorting'],
    missingConcepts: ['Dynamic Programming'],
    platform: 'leetcode',
    learningStyle: 'progressive',
  },
  availableQuestions
);
```

### Get Learning Path

```typescript
const learningPath = await advancedQuestionSelector.getLearningPath(
  userId,
  'leetcode',
  'Medium',
  10 // number of questions
);
```

---

## üîß Integration with Suggestion Service

### Update `suggestionService.ts`

```typescript
import { advancedQuestionSelector } from './advancedQuestionSelector';

async generateSuggestions(...) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Use advanced selector for better recommendations
  const selectedQuestions = await advancedQuestionSelector.selectOptimalQuestions(
    {
      userId,
      currentDifficulty: difficulty,
      topics,
      missingConcepts,
      platform,
      learningStyle: 'progressive',
    },
    availableQuestions
  );
  
  return {
    prerequisites: [...],
    similarProblems: selectedQuestions.map(q => ({
      title: q.title,
      tags: q.reasons,
      reason: q.reasons.join(', '),
      url: q.url,
      platform: q.platform,
    })),
    microtasks: [...]
  };
}
```
