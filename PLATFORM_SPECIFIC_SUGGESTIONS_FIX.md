# Platform-Specific LLM Suggestions - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Fixed
The LLM suggestion feature was generating the same generic suggestions for all problems, regardless of platform (LeetCode, CodeForces, AtCoder) or problem content.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 3 Files Modified

#### 1. **src/lib/llm-prompts.ts**
Enhanced the `suggestionGeneratorPrompt` function to accept and use platform context:

```typescript
export const suggestionGeneratorPrompt = (
  problemTitle: string,
  difficulty: string,
  topics: string[],
  missingConcepts: string[],
  failureReason: string,
  platform?: string,        // NEW: Platform context
  url?: string,             // NEW: Problem URL
  companies?: string[]      // NEW: Associated companies
): string
```

**Changes:**
- Added platform-specific guidance in prompt
- Included URL for LLM reference
- Added company context
- Platform-specific instructions:
  - CodeForces: Focus on rating/difficulty
  - LeetCode: Focus on tags/difficulty
  - AtCoder: Focus on contest context

#### 2. **src/services/suggestionService.ts**
Updated the `generateSuggestions()` method signature:

```typescript
async generateSuggestions(
  problemTitle: string,
  difficulty: string,
  topics: string[],
  missingConcepts: string[],
  failureReason: string,
  platform?: string,        // NEW
  url?: string,             // NEW
  companies?: string[]      // NEW
): Promise<SuggestionsResult>
```

**Changes:**
- Accepts new platform parameters
- Passes them to the enhanced prompt function

#### 3. **src/app/api/problems/[id]/llm-result/route.ts**
Updated API route to pass complete problem data:

```typescript
const suggestions = await suggestionService.generateSuggestions(
  problem.title,
  problem.difficulty,
  problem.topics || [],
  failureDetection.missing_concepts,
  failureDetection.failure_reason,
  problem.platform,         // NEW: Pass platform
  problem.url,              // NEW: Pass URL
  problem.companies || []   // NEW: Pass companies
);
```

**Changes:**
- Retrieves complete problem data from database
- Passes platform, URL, and companies to service
- Added logging: "Generating suggestions for platform: [platform]"
- Fixed Next.js 15 params handling (await params)

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow

```
Problem in Database
â”œâ”€â”€ platform: "leetcode" | "codeforces" | "atcoder"
â”œâ”€â”€ url: "https://..."
â”œâ”€â”€ companies: ["Google", "Amazon"]
â””â”€â”€ topics: ["Array", "Hash Table"]
    â†“
API Route retrieves ALL problem data
    â†“
Passes to suggestionService.generateSuggestions()
    â†“
Service creates prompt with platform context
    â†“
Prompt includes:
â”œâ”€â”€ Platform-specific guidance
â”œâ”€â”€ Problem URL
â”œâ”€â”€ Associated companies
â””â”€â”€ Topics and difficulty
    â†“
Gemini API generates platform-specific suggestions
    â†“
Suggestions cached and returned
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

### LeetCode Problems
âœ… Suggestions mention LeetCode-specific problems
âœ… Focus on similar tags and difficulty
âœ… Company hiring patterns considered
âœ… Example: "Try LeetCode problem X with similar tags"

### CodeForces Problems
âœ… Suggestions mention CodeForces-specific problems
âœ… Focus on similar rating/difficulty
âœ… Competitive programming context
âœ… Example: "Try CodeForces problem with rating Y"

### AtCoder Problems
âœ… Suggestions mention AtCoder-specific problems
âœ… Focus on similar difficulty
âœ… Contest-style problem context
âœ… Example: "Try AtCoder problem from similar contest"

## ðŸ§ª Quick Test

1. **Hard refresh browser**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Go to Review tab**
3. **Click ðŸ’¡ button on LeetCode problem**
   - Verify suggestions mention LeetCode
4. **Click ðŸ’¡ button on CodeForces problem**
   - Verify suggestions mention CodeForces
   - Verify different from LeetCode suggestions
5. **Click ðŸ’¡ button on AtCoder problem**
   - Verify suggestions mention AtCoder
   - Verify different from other platforms

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Dev server running successfully
