- [ ] AtCoder suggestions are platform-specific
- [ ] Each platform has different suggestions
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Caching works (second request is instant)

## 📋 Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Got new API key from Google AI Studio
- [ ] Updated `.env.local` with new key
- [ ] Restarted dev server
- [ ] Dev server shows: `✓ Ready in X.Xs`

### During Testing
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser
- [ ] Navigated to Review tab
- [ ] Clicked 💡 on LeetCode problem
- [ ] Clicked 💡 on CodeForces problem
- [ ] Clicked 💡 on AtCoder problem
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors
- [ ] Checked Network tab for API responses

### After Testing
- [ ] Suggestions are platform-specific
- [ ] Each platform has different suggestions
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Caching works (second request is instant)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting API errors

**Solution 1**: Verify API key
- Copy key from Google AI Studio again
- Make sure no extra spaces
- Check `.env.local` is saved

**Solution 2**: Check API key permissions
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Verify API key has access to Generative Language API

**Solution 3**: Check quota
- Free tier: 60 requests/minute
- May need to wait or upgrade

**Solution 4**: Try different model
- Edit `src/services/suggestionService.ts` line 51
- Change `gemini-2.0-flash` to `gemini-1.5-pro`
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Suggestions still generic

**Solution 1**: Hard refresh browser
- Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

**Solution 2**: Check Network tab
- Look for POST to `/api/problems/[id]/llm-result`
- Verify request includes: platform, url, companies, topics
- Verify response includes suggestions

**Solution 3**: Check console logs
- Should see: "Generating suggestions for platform: [platform]"
- Should NOT see errors
