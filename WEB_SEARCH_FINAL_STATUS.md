## 🔄 How It Works

### Current Implementation
```
1. User clicks 💡 button
2. LLM generates initial suggestions
3. Web search service attempts to find real problems
4. If search succeeds: URLs added to suggestions

6. Frontend displays suggestions with "Open" buttons
7. User can click to open problems directly
```

### Graceful Fallback
- If web search fails → Uses LLM suggestions
- No errors displayed to user
- Suggestions still helpful
- Seamless experience
