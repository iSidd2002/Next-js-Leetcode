## üìä CodeForces Optimization Details

### Enhanced Context
```
CODEFORCES CONTEXT:
- This is a competitive programming problem
- Focus on algorithmic efficiency and time complexity
- Suggest problems with similar rating/difficulty
- Include problems that teach similar algorithmic techniques
- Consider Codeforces rating system (800-3500)
- Suggest problems from Codeforces, AtCoder, or similar competitive platforms
- Emphasize optimization and edge case handling
- Problem format: "Codeforces [ContestID][ProblemLetter] - [ProblemName] (Rating [rating])"
- Examples: "Codeforces 1234A - Game (Rating 800)", "Codeforces 1567B - Optimal Moves (Rating 1200)"
- Include the contest ID, problem letter (A-F), and rating
- Suggest problems with ratings within 200-400 points of the current problem
- Include problems from different contests to show pattern variety
```

### Rating Mapping
```typescript
const ratingMap = {
  'Easy': [800, 1000, 1200],
  'Medium': [1200, 1400, 1600],
  'Hard': [1600, 1800, 2000],
  '800': [800, 1000, 1200],
  '1000': [1000, 1200, 1400],
  '1200': [1200, 1400, 1600],
  '1400': [1400, 1600, 1800],
  '1600': [1600, 1800, 2000],
};
```

### Multiple Search Queries
```
Query 1: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:800
Query 2: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:1000
Query 3: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:1200
```

### Title Extraction
```
Input: "A - Game | Codeforces 1234"
Output: "Codeforces 1234A - Game"

Format: Codeforces [ContestID][Letter] - [ProblemName]
```

## üìä AtCoder Optimization Details

### Enhanced Context
```
ATCODER CONTEXT:
- This is a Japanese competitive programming problem
- AtCoder problems are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F within contests
- Problem difficulty increases significantly from A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíD‚ÜíE‚ÜíF
- Focus on mathematical and algorithmic thinking
- Suggest problems with similar difficulty and concepts
- Include problems that teach similar mathematical techniques
- For problem A/B: Focus on implementation and basic algorithms
- For problem C/D: Focus on data structures and intermediate algorithms
- For problem E/F: Focus on advanced algorithms and mathematical insights
- Suggest specific AtCoder problems (e.g., "AtCoder ABC123A")
- Include the contest name and problem letter (e.g., ABC, ARC, AGC)
- Emphasize mathematical insights and elegant solutions
- Consider that AtCoder problems often have tight time/memory limits
```

### Difficulty Mapping
```typescript
const difficultyMap = {
  'Easy': ['A', 'B'],
  'Medium': ['C', 'D'],
  'Hard': ['E', 'F'],
  '800': ['A', 'B'],
  '1000': ['B', 'C'],
  '1200': ['C', 'D'],
  '1400': ['D', 'E'],
  '1600': ['E', 'F'],
};
```

### Multiple Search Queries
```
Query 1: site:atcoder.jp A [topics]
Query 2: site:atcoder.jp B [topics]
(or C/D or E/F depending on difficulty)
```

### Title Extraction
```
Input: "A - Problem Name | AtCoder ABC123"
Output: "AtCoder ABC123A - Problem Name"

Format: AtCoder [ContestName][Letter] - [ProblemName]
```
