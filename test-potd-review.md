## ðŸ§ª **TESTING WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Add POTD Problem**
1. Go to POTD tab
2. Click "Quick Add to POTD List" on today's problem
3. Verify problem appears in POTD list

### **Step 2: Mark for Review**
1. In POTD tab, click the star button on a POTD problem
2. Verify success message: "Problem marked for review! First review scheduled."
3. Check that star button is now highlighted (yellow)

### **Step 3: Verify in Review Tab**
1. Go to Review tab
2. Verify the POTD problem appears in the review list
3. Check that review badge shows correct count
4. Verify next review date is set (2 days from now)

### **Step 4: Test Review Process**
1. In Review tab, click "Mark as Reviewed" on the POTD problem
2. Select quality rating (1-5)
3. Verify success message with next review interval
4. Check that next review date is updated

### **Step 5: Test Persistence**
1. Wait for POTD problem to expire (or manually trigger cleanup)
2. Verify that reviewed POTD problems remain in Review tab
3. Check that non-reviewed POTD problems are cleaned up
4. Confirm review progress is preserved
