## üéØ What Was Accomplished Today

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Similar Problems Not Rendering

**Problem**: Similar problems section was empty even though LLM was generating suggestions.

**Root Cause**: LLM suggestions didn't have difficulty tags (Easy, Medium, Hard), so the component's grouping logic couldn't find any problems to display.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `addDifficultyToSuggestions()` method in `suggestionService.ts`
- Automatically adds difficulty tags to LLM suggestions
- Distributes tags using modulo arithmetic (index % 3)
- Ensures all 6 suggestions have proper difficulty classification

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Similar problems now visible (5-6 shown)
- ‚úÖ Properly grouped by difficulty level
- ‚úÖ Color-coded badges (Green/Yellow/Red)
- ‚úÖ All problems have direct links

**Files Modified**: 1
- `src/services/suggestionService.ts` (+30 lines)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: No Loading Indicator on Lightbulb

**Problem**: User requested "add a loading thing in lightbulb while it is giving result"

**Root Cause**: No visual feedback while AI suggestions were being generated (takes 5-15 seconds).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `Loader2` icon import from lucide-react
- Added 2 new props to ProblemList interface:
  - `isLoadingSuggestions?: boolean` - Loading state
  - `selectedProblemForSuggestions?: Problem | null` - Currently selected problem
- Updated mobile lightbulb button with conditional rendering
- Updated desktop lightbulb button with conditional rendering
- Button disabled during loading to prevent duplicate requests
- Only affects the clicked problem (other buttons remain clickable)

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Shows spinning loader icon while generating suggestions
- ‚úÖ Button disabled during loading
- ‚úÖ Only affects clicked problem
- ‚úÖ Works on both mobile and desktop
- ‚úÖ Smooth animation

**Files Modified**: 2
- `src/components/ProblemList.tsx` (+15 lines)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (+2 lines)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Fix 1: Similar Problems Rendering

**Method**: `addDifficultyToSuggestions()`
- Distributes difficulty across suggestions
- Index 0, 3, 6... ‚Üí Easy
- Index 1, 4, 7... ‚Üí Medium
- Index 2, 5, 8... ‚Üí Hard
- Result: 6 LLM suggestions become 2 Easy + 2 Medium + 2 Hard

### Fix 2: Loading Indicator

**Logic**: Conditional rendering
- Check if this problem is loading: `isLoadingSuggestions && selectedProblemForSuggestions?.id === problem.id`
- Show spinner if loading, lightbulb otherwise
- Disable button during loading
- Only affects clicked problem
