- **Search**: Multiple rating levels (800, 1000, 1200, etc.)
- **Format**: "Codeforces [ID][Letter] - [Name] (Rating [rating])"
- **Goal**: Find problems with similar difficulty and techniques

### AtCoder Optimization
- **Focus**: Level-based difficulty matching (A-F)
- **Search**: Multiple letter queries (A, B, C, D, E, F)
- **Format**: "AtCoder [Contest][Letter] - [Name]"
- **Goal**: Find problems with similar difficulty and concepts

```

### Rating Mapping
```
Easy (800-1200):
  - 800: Beginner problems
  - 1000: Early intermediate
  - 1200: Intermediate

Medium (1200-1600):
  - 1200: Intermediate
  - 1400: Advanced intermediate
  - 1600: Advanced

Hard (1600-2000):
  - 1600: Advanced
  - 1800: Very advanced
  - 2000: Expert
```

### Search Strategy
```
For difficulty 1200:
  Query 1: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:1200
  Query 2: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:1400
  Query 3: site:codeforces.com problem [topics] rating:1600

Result: Problems at similar and slightly higher difficulty
```

## üîç Title Extraction

### CodeForces Format
```
Input: "A - Game | Codeforces 1234"
Extraction: Contest ID (1234) + Letter (A) + Name (Game)
Output: "Codeforces 1234A - Game"

Regex: /([A-F])\s*-\s*([^|]+)\|?\s*(?:Codeforces\s+)?(\d+)?/i
```

### AtCoder Format
```
Input: "A - Problem Name | AtCoder ABC123"
Extraction: Contest (ABC123) + Letter (A) + Name (Problem Name)
Output: "AtCoder ABC123A - Problem Name"

Regex: /([A-F])\s*-\s*([^|]+)\|?\s*(?:AtCoder\s+)?([A-Z]+\d+)?/i
```
