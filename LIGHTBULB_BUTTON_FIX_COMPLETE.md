# 🔧 Lightbulb Button Visibility Fix - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Issue**: Lightbulb button was hidden in Review tab desktop view
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Root Cause
In the Review tab (desktop view), the `isReviewList={true}` condition caused the Actions cell to display ONLY the "Reviewed & Advance" button, completely hiding:
- The lightbulb (💡) button for AI suggestions
- Any other action buttons

### Location
**File**: `src/components/ProblemList.tsx`
**Lines**: 385-441 (Desktop table layout)
**Component**: ProblemList Actions cell

### Why It Happened
The code had a conditional that showed different layouts:
```typescript
{isReviewList ? (
  <Button>Reviewed & Advance</Button>  // Only this button shown
) : (
  <DropdownMenu>...</DropdownMenu>     // Dropdown for other tabs
)}
```

This meant the lightbulb button (which was only in the dropdown) was never visible in the Review tab.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Change Made
Modified the Review tab Actions cell to display BOTH:
1. The lightbulb (💡) button for AI suggestions
2. The "Reviewed & Advance" button

### Code Change
**Before**:
```typescript
{isReviewList ? (
  <Button size="sm" onClick={() => onProblemReviewed(problem.id, 4)} disabled={!isDueForReview(problem)}>
    Reviewed & Advance
  </Button>
) : (
  // dropdown menu
)}
```

**After**:
```typescript
{isReviewList ? (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-end gap-2">
    {onGenerateSuggestions && (
      <Button
        variant="ghost"
        size="icon"
        onClick={() => onGenerateSuggestions(problem)}
        className="h-8 w-8 text-blue-600"
        title="Get AI suggestions"
      >
        <Lightbulb className="h-4 w-4" />
      </Button>
    )}
    <Button size="sm" onClick={() => onProblemReviewed(problem.id, 4)} disabled={!isDueForReview(problem)}>
      Reviewed & Advance
    </Button>
  </div>
) : (
  // dropdown menu
)}
```

### Key Improvements
1. ✅ Wrapped buttons in a flex container with `gap-2` for spacing
2. ✅ Added conditional rendering for lightbulb button
3. ✅ Positioned buttons to the right with `justify-end`
4. ✅ Maintained "Reviewed & Advance" button functionality
5. ✅ Added proper styling and tooltip
