## üéØ **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

### **What This Feature Does:**
- **Transfers POTD problems** from the POTD section to the regular Problems section
- **Preserves all data** including review status, spaced repetition data, notes, topics, etc.
- **Updates problem source** from 'potd' to 'manual' for proper categorization
- **Maintains all functionality** including review system, editing, and deletion
- **Provides immediate feedback** with success/error messages

### **Why This Feature Is Valuable:**
- **Flexibility**: Users can permanently keep valuable POTD problems
- **Organization**: Important problems can be moved to main collection
- **Continuity**: Review progress and all data is preserved
- **No Duplication**: Problems are properly transferred, not copied

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Handler Function (`handleMovePotdToProblem`)**
```typescript
const handleMovePotdToProblem = async (id: string) => {
  // Find POTD problem
  // Change source from 'potd' to 'manual'
  // Update database
  // Update local state (add to problems, remove from potdProblems)
  // Update storage
  // Show success message
};
```

### **2. UI Components Enhanced**
- **ProblemList Component**: Added `onMoveToProblem` prop
- **Mobile Layout**: Arrow button for POTD problems
- **Desktop Layout**: "Move to Problems" dropdown option
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows for `source === 'potd'`

### **3. Data Flow**
```
POTD Problem ‚Üí Move Action ‚Üí Database Update ‚Üí State Update ‚Üí UI Refresh
```
