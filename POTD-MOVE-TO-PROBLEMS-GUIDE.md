## üéØ **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

### **What This Enhanced Feature Does:**
- **Organizes POTD problems by month** with collapsible sections (e.g., "July 2024", "August 2024")

- **Provides enhanced UI/UX** with clear status indicators and visual feedback

### **Why This Enhanced Feature Is Valuable:**
- **Complete Historical Archive**: All POTD problems organized by month for easy browsing
- **Flexible Problem Management**: Copy favorite POTD problems to main collection
- **No Data Loss**: Original POTD problems remain in archive forever
- **Smart Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents confusion and duplicate entries
- **Enhanced Organization**: Monthly grouping makes finding specific problems easy
- **Improved User Experience**: Clear visual indicators and intuitive interface

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Handler Function (`handleMovePotdToProblem`)**
```typescript
const handleMovePotdToProblem = async (id: string) => {
  // Find POTD problem
  // Change source from 'potd' to 'manual'
  // Update database
  // Update local state (add to problems, remove from potdProblems)
  // Update storage
  // Show success message
};
```

### **2. UI Components Enhanced**
- **ProblemList Component**: Added `onMoveToProblem` prop
- **Mobile Layout**: Arrow button for POTD problems
- **Desktop Layout**: "Move to Problems" dropdown option
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows for `source === 'potd'`

### **3. Data Flow**
```
POTD Problem ‚Üí Move Action ‚Üí Database Update ‚Üí State Update ‚Üí UI Refresh
```

## üß™ **TESTING WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Test Monthly Organization**
1. Go to POTD tab
2. Add multiple POTD problems (if none exist)
3. Verify problems are grouped by month (e.g., "July 2024")
4. Test collapsible month sections by clicking month headers
5. Verify problem counts are displayed correctly

### **Step 2: Test Copy Functionality**
**Desktop:**
1. Click the three-dot menu (‚ãØ) on a POTD problem
2. Select "Add to Problems" option
3. Verify success message appears
4. Check that problem remains in POTD section

**Mobile:**
1. Look for the "Add to Problems" button on POTD problems
2. Tap the button
3. Verify success message appears
4. Check that problem remains in POTD section

### **Step 3: Verify Copy Operation**
1. Confirm problem remains in POTD tab (organized by month)
2. Go to Problems tab
3. Verify problem appears in Problems list with new ID
4. Confirm all data is preserved (title, difficulty, notes, etc.)
5. If problem was marked for review, check Review tab

### **Step 4: Test Duplicate Prevention**
1. Try to add the same POTD problem again
2. Verify button shows "Already in Problems" or is disabled
3. Check that "In Problems" badge appears on the POTD problem
4. Confirm no duplicate is created in Problems section

### **Step 5: Test Continued Functionality**
1. Try editing problems in both POTD and Problems sections
2. Test review functionality in both sections
3. Verify delete functionality works in both sections
4. Confirm all handlers work properly for both copies

## üìä **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **‚úÖ What Should Work:**
- **Monthly Organization**: POTD problems grouped by month with collapsible sections
- **Copy Process**: Smooth copying from POTD to Problems while preserving original
- **Data Preservation**: All problem data remains intact in both sections
- **Review System**: Spaced repetition works independently in both sections
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart detection prevents duplicate entries
- **UI Updates**: Immediate addition to Problems, POTD remains unchanged
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for problem states
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failures

### **‚úÖ Data Preserved During Transfer:**
- ‚úÖ Title, difficulty, URL, platform
- ‚úÖ Topics and companies
- ‚úÖ Notes and solve date
- ‚úÖ Review status (`isReview`)
- ‚úÖ Spaced repetition data (`repetition`, `interval`, `nextReviewDate`)
- ‚úÖ Problem status (`active`/`learned`)
- ‚úÖ All timestamps and metadata

### **‚úÖ Source Field Changes:**
- **POTD Section**: `source: 'potd'` (remains unchanged)
- **Problems Section Copy**: `source: 'manual'` (new copy)
- **Result**: Original in POTD archive, copy in Problems section

### **‚úÖ Monthly Organization:**
- **Grouping**: Problems grouped by month (e.g., "July 2024", "August 2024")
- **Sorting**: Newest months appear first
- **Collapsible**: Each month section can be expanded/collapsed
- **Counts**: Problem count displayed for each month
- **Visual**: Calendar icons and clear month indicators
