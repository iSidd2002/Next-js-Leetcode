#### **1. ‚úÖ Daily Challenge API Endpoint**
- **Route**: `/api/daily-challenge` with GET method
- **LeetCode Integration**: Attempts to fetch random problems from LeetCode API
- **Date-based Caching**: Same problem shows consistently throughout the day
- **Fallback System**: 5 high-quality fallback problems with deterministic selection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with backup problems

#### **2. ‚úÖ DailyChallenge Component**
- **Beautiful Design**: Gradient card with purple/blue theme
- **Problem Display**: Title, difficulty, platform, acceptance rate, topics
- **Direct Links**: "Solve Challenge" button opens problem on LeetCode
- **POTD Integration**: "Add to POTD" button for archiving interesting problems
- **Refresh Capability**: Manual refresh for new challenges
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and error states

#### **3. ‚úÖ Dashboard Integration**
- **Seamless Placement**: Added to Dashboard grid layout
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing Dashboard component design
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across all screen sizes
- **Handler Integration**: Proper connection to POTD archive system

#### **4. ‚úÖ Complete Workflow Integration**
- **Discovery**: Daily Challenge provides new problem discovery
- **Archiving**: Problems can be added to POTD monthly archive
- **Management**: Enhanced POTD management for flexible categorization
- **Tracking**: Full lifecycle from discovery to long-term tracking

## üß™ **TESTING WORKFLOW**

### **Part A: Enhanced POTD Management Testing**

#### **Step 1: Test Dropdown Functionality**
1. Go to POTD tab
2. Find a POTD problem in monthly view
3. Click the dropdown button (should show "Add to Problems" with down arrow)
4. Verify two options appear: "Add as Active Problem" and "Add as Learned Problem"

#### **Step 2: Test Active Problem Addition**
1. Select "Add as Active Problem" from dropdown
2. Verify success message: "Problem added to Problems section successfully!"
3. Go to Problems tab and confirm problem appears with `status='active'`
4. Return to POTD tab and verify badge shows "In Problems"
5. Check that "Add as Active Problem" option is now disabled

#### **Step 3: Test Learned Problem Addition**
1. Find a different POTD problem
2. Select "Add as Learned Problem" from dropdown
3. Verify success message: "Problem added to Learned section successfully!"
4. Go to Learned tab and confirm problem appears with `status='learned'`
5. Return to POTD tab and verify badge shows "In Learned"

#### **Step 4: Test Dual Status**
1. Find a POTD problem and add as Active Problem
2. Add the same problem as Learned Problem
3. Verify badge shows "In Both"
4. Check that both dropdown options are disabled
5. Confirm problem appears in both Problems and Learned tabs

### **Part B: Daily Challenge Testing**

#### **Step 1: Test Daily Challenge Display**
1. Go to Dashboard tab
2. Locate "Daily Challenge" card (purple gradient design)
3. Verify problem displays with title, difficulty, platform, topics
4. Check that acceptance rate is shown
5. Verify current date is displayed in header

#### **Step 2: Test External Links**
1. Click "Solve Challenge" button
2. Verify it opens LeetCode problem page in new tab
3. Confirm URL matches the displayed problem

#### **Step 3: Test POTD Integration**
1. Click "Add to POTD" button
2. Verify success message: "Daily challenge added to POTD archive!"
3. Go to POTD tab and confirm problem appears in current month
4. Try adding same problem again and verify duplicate prevention

#### **Step 4: Test Refresh Functionality**
1. Click "Refresh Challenge" button at bottom of card
2. Verify loading state appears
3. Confirm new problem loads (may be same if cached for the day)

#### **Step 5: Test Enhanced Management Integration**
1. Add Daily Challenge problem to POTD archive
2. Use enhanced dropdown to add as Active or Learned problem
3. Verify complete workflow from discovery to categorization
