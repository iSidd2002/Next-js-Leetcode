## 🎯 Key Features

### Mixed Difficulty Distribution
```
Easy Level:   2 problems (Rating 800 / ABC_A / Easy)
Medium Level: 2 problems (Rating 1000 / ABC_C / Medium)
Hard Level:   2 problems (Rating 1600 / ABC_E / Hard)
Total:        6 problems
```

### Visual Organization
```
🔗 Similar Problems (6)

EASY LEVEL
├─ Problem 1 [Easy] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
└─ Problem 2 [Easy] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]

MEDIUM LEVEL
├─ Problem 3 [Medium] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
└─ Problem 4 [Medium] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]

HARD LEVEL
├─ Problem 5 [Hard] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]
└─ Problem 6 [Hard] [Tag1] [Tag2] [Platform] [Open]

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: User Action
User clicks 💡 icon on a problem in Review section

### Step 2: API Call
```
POST /api/problems/[id]/llm-result
{
  failureReason: "...",
  missingConcepts: ["..."],
  difficulty: "1000",
  topics: ["Math"],
  platform: "codeforces"
}
```

### Step 3: Service Processing
```
generateSuggestions()
  ↓
enrichSimilarProblemsWithWebSearch()
  ↓
getVariedDifficultySuggestions()
  ├─ searchCodeForcesProblem('800', ...)  → 2 Easy
  ├─ searchCodeForcesProblem('1000', ...) → 2 Medium
  └─ searchCodeForcesProblem('1600', ...) → 2 Hard
  ↓
rankSuggestionsByTags()
  ↓
Return 6 problems with difficulty labels
```

### Step 4: UI Rendering
```
SuggestionPanel receives 6 problems
  ↓
Groups by difficulty level
  ├─ Easy Level (2 problems)
  ├─ Medium Level (2 problems)
  └─ Hard Level (2 problems)
  ↓
Renders with color-coded badges
  ↓
User sees organized suggestions
```

### Step 5: User Interaction
User clicks "Open" on a problem
  ↓
Opens in new tab
  ↓
User practices the problem
