# Understanding the LeetCode Tracker - Complete Summary

## üéØ What This Project Does

This is a **full-stack web application** that helps developers master coding problems through intelligent tracking and spaced repetition learning. Think of it as a personal tutor that reminds you to review problems at optimal times for maximum retention.

### Real-World Use Case
```
Developer's Journey:
1. Solves a LeetCode problem on Day 1
2. App reminds them to review on Day 3
3. They review and rate difficulty
4. App schedules next review for Day 7
5. Process repeats until problem is mastered
6. Developer can track progress across companies and platforms
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built - The 3 Layers

### Layer 1: Frontend (What Users See)
- **Technology**: React 19 + Next.js 15
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI components
- **Location**: `src/components/` and `src/app/page.tsx`
- **What it does**: 
  - Displays dashboard with tabs (Problems, Contests, Todos, etc.)
  - Shows forms for adding/editing data
  - Renders charts and statistics
  - Handles user interactions

### Layer 2: Backend (The Brain)
- **Technology**: Next.js API Routes + Node.js
- **Location**: `src/app/api/`
- **What it does**:
  - Handles user registration and login
  - Processes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Validates data
  - Manages authentication
  - Fetches external data (LeetCode POTD, contests)

### Layer 3: Database (The Memory)
- **Technology**: MongoDB + Prisma ORM
- **Location**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **What it does**:
  - Stores user accounts
  - Stores problems, contests, todos
  - Maintains relationships between data
  - Persists all user information

## üîÑ How Data Flows Through the System

### Example: Adding a Problem

```
1. User clicks "Add Problem" button
   ‚Üì
2. Form appears with fields (title, difficulty, URL, etc.)
   ‚Üì
3. User fills form and clicks "Submit"
   ‚Üì
4. Frontend calls StorageService.addProblem(data)
   ‚Üì
5. StorageService calls ApiService.createProblem(data)
   ‚Üì
6. ApiService makes HTTP POST to /api/problems
   ‚Üì
7. Middleware verifies JWT token (is user logged in?)
   ‚Üì
8. API route receives request with user ID
   ‚Üì
9. API creates problem in MongoDB with userId
   ‚Üì
10. Database returns created problem
   ‚Üì
11. API sends response back to frontend
   ‚Üì
12. Frontend caches in localStorage
   ‚Üì
13. Frontend updates UI to show new problem
   ‚Üì
14. User sees problem in Problems tab
```

## üîê Authentication - How Security Works

### The Problem
- We need to know WHO is making requests
- We need to prevent unauthorized access
- We need to keep passwords safe

### The Solution: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

```
Registration:
1. User enters email + password
2. Password is hashed (bcryptjs) - can't be reversed
3. User stored in database with hashed password
4. JWT token generated (like a digital ID card)
5. Token sent to user in HTTP-only cookie

Login:
1. User enters email + password
2. System finds user by email
3. Compares entered password with stored hash
4. If match, generates JWT token
5. Token sent in cookie

Subsequent Requests:
1. Browser automatically includes token in cookie
2. Middleware verifies token signature
3. If valid, extracts user ID
4. User ID attached to request
5. API knows which user is making request
6. Returns only that user's data
```

## üìä The Spaced Repetition Algorithm

### Why It Works
Research shows we forget things over time. Spaced repetition fights this by:
- Reviewing material just before you forget it
- Gradually increasing review intervals
- Adjusting based on how well you know the material

### How It Works in This App

```
Initial State:
- repetition = 0
- interval = 1 day
- nextReviewDate = today + 1 day

After First Review (user rates quality 0-5):
- Quality 0-2 (forgot): Reset to interval=1
- Quality 3 (struggled): interval = interval √ó 1.3
- Quality 4 (good): interval = interval √ó 1.5
- Quality 5 (perfect): interval = interval √ó 2.0

Example Progression:
Day 1: Learn problem
Day 2: Review (quality=4) ‚Üí next review in 1.5 days
Day 3.5: Review (quality=4) ‚Üí next review in 2.25 days
Day 5.75: Review (quality=4) ‚Üí next review in 3.375 days
...continues until mastered
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Concepts Explained

### Problems vs POTD vs Company Problems
```
Manual Problems:
- User adds manually
- Tracked in Problems tab
- Can be marked for review
- Source: 'manual'

POTD (Problem of the Day):
- Fetched from LeetCode daily
- Stored separately
- Can be moved to Problems
- Source: 'potd'
- Auto-cleanup after 30 days

Company Problems:
- Imported from company lists
- Organized by company
- Tracked separately
- Source: 'company'
```

### Problem Status
```
Active: Currently working on or reviewing
Learned: Mastered, no longer needs review
```

### Problem Source
```
'manual': User added manually
'company': Imported from company problems
'potd': From Problem of the Day
```

## üîå API Endpoints - What They Do

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/register
  Input: email, username, password
  Output: user info, JWT token
  
POST /api/auth/login
  Input: email, password
  Output: user info, JWT token
  
GET /api/auth/profile
  Input: JWT token (in cookie)
  Output: current user info
```

### Problems
```
GET /api/problems
  Returns: all user's problems
  
POST /api/problems
  Creates: new problem
  
PUT /api/problems/[id]
  Updates: existing problem
  
DELETE /api/problems/[id]
  Deletes: problem
```
